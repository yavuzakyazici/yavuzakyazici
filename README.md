🎸 Jazz Musician | 💻 Full-Stack Developer | 📱 Indie App Creator

I’m a senior full-stack developer with a passion for turning complex ideas into simple, polished experiences. I’ve built and launched **Jazz‑A‑Minute (J.A.M.)**, a cross-platform jazz education app used by paying subscribers, and I continue to expand my toolkit with powerful backend and frontend stacks.
